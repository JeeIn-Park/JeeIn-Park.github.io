      "Ever since I was little, people have called me the most creative person they know. One friend once said I wasn’t just five-dimensional, but six. Apparently, that extra dimension was the only way to contain me.",
      "Back in school, I was voted 'Most Likely to Communicate with Aliens.' I still think about that sometimes, and honestly, I’m proud of it. It says a lot about how I’ve always seen the world a little differently.",
      "So, where does all that creativity go? For me, the answer has always been optimisation. I love simplifying things. Finding better paths. Reducing friction. My imagination comes alive when I get to untangle something and rebuild it to work beautifully.",
      "That urge to improve led me to a gifted education programme. Most students chose maths or science, which made perfect sense. I love those too. I’m definitely a nerd. But when I saw a course titled 'Invention', something inside me lit up. I just knew. This was the one.",
      "When I filled out the application, I only wrote one word in the hobbies section: imagining. I spend so much time in my own head, dreaming up strange and curious ideas. Sometimes they’re completely impractical, but they’re never boring.",
      "The entrance exam focused on creativity and problem solving. A lot of people said it was difficult. I didn’t notice. I was too busy enjoying myself. It felt like solving a set of puzzles made just for me. I ended up placing first and joined the programme.",
      "Being in that environment helped me realise something important. What I love most is bringing ideas to life, especially the kind that makes everyday tasks simpler, smarter, and more human.",
      "That idea slowly turned into a mission. I want to build things that ease the load. Tools and systems that help people work better, not harder. When I can turn effort into flow, I feel like I’ve done something meaningful. It’s more than a goal for me. It’s a way of living.",
      "I never felt the need to limit that mission to one field or job title. There are so many ways to create change. I started with physical tools and gadgets. Then came macros. Then came software. Each new project taught me to see wider, think deeper, and build better.",
      "Eventually, I graduated at the top of the invention track with an award. Creativity has always been my engine. But engines need more than one part to move. Two other forces keep mine running."

  "sensitivity": {
    "title": "Sensitivity",
    "paragraphs": [
      "I’m a sensitive person. I know, it can be a bit much sometimes. But that same sensitivity is what gives me empathy. It helps me see things more clearly, and feel things more deeply.",
      "It makes me naturally attuned to user needs, emotions, and frustrations. I notice feedback quickly, even when it isn’t spoken out loud. That gives me a chance to create tools and systems that people didn’t even know they needed.",
      "I often find solutions by connecting dots that others might miss. Sometimes that means mixing ideas from unrelated fields. Other times, it’s about using something familiar in a totally different way.",
      "When I was in the gifted programme, I was taught to challenge assumptions, take risks, and never ignore even the tiniest issues. And I don’t. I really can’t. If something seems off, no matter how small, it keeps tugging at me until I do something about it.",
      "I’ve developed a habit of spotting friction in everyday life. The kinds of things most people just live with. Visit my place and you’ll probably raise an eyebrow. Nothing is where you expect it to be. Everything has been optimised, to the point where it probably seems a little weird.",
      "When someone says, 'That’s not a big deal,' I’m already ten thoughts deep into how to improve it.",
      "I know. It probably sounds exhausting. Writing this down just makes it even more obvious. But honestly, I think it’s one of the best things about me."

  },
  "passion": {
    "title": "Passion",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Spotting problems is just the beginning. What really matters is solving them — and doing it well. I’ve never been someone who settles for 'good enough.' Take my personal planner, for example. I’ve redesigned it over a hundred times. I’m not exaggerating.",
      "I’m basically a walking version of a genetic algorithm. I iterate, I learn, I evolve. If I find a better way to do something, I follow it. And I don’t stop there. I keep refining it, again and again.",
      "That kind of persistence comes from a deep, restless curiosity. I need to understand how things work. Not just on the surface, but underneath. Why this formula? How do these parts connect? What exactly triggers that effect?",
      "I ask 'why' so often that it probably drives people a little crazy. But that constant questioning has helped me understand complex systems, and more importantly, improve them.",
      "That curiosity doesn’t stop at technology. I’ve lived in different countries and experienced life through different cultures. And I noticed something interesting. The same object can be used in completely different ways, depending on where you are and how people see it.",
      "Maybe that’s why I love upcycling so much. (You might have spotted it on my CV.) It’s about redefining value. Seeing beauty in things others would throw away. Giving something new meaning just by choosing to look at it differently."

  "proactive": {
    "title": "Proactive Problem-Solving with Unique Ideas",
    "paragraphs": [
      "When creativity, sensitivity, and persistence come together, they form something powerful. For me, they’ve become my core strength: solving problems through original, thoughtful ideas.",
      "The gifted programme, my multicultural experiences, and all the different types of projects I’ve taken on have taught me how to channel those strengths into real, meaningful change.",
      "Here’s one example. I noticed that a lot of people at the gym weren’t using workout apps. They were tracking their progress with notes, spreadsheets, or just memory.",
      "I wrote it down instantly. It felt like something worth exploring.",
      "I went to my professor with a dozen ideas. He wasn’t just surprised by the number, but by how unusual they were. He offered to supervise one of them, and I got to work.",
      "I built the app. Then I launched it.",
      "Getting users on board wasn’t difficult. I listened carefully to what they needed and gave it to them in a way that felt natural. I also added gentle psychological nudges that encouraged people to stick with it.",
      "It wasn’t about gamification or flashy social features. I went deeper, focusing on how people really think and feel. And it worked. User satisfaction rose, and they kept coming back.",
      "Having the technical skills to build something is just the starting point. Innovation comes from knowing what matters, and finding a better way to make it happen.",
      "That’s what I bring to the table. Something not everyone can offer.",
      "People often turn to me and say, 'This one’s yours. You’re the creative one. Find a way to make it work.' And I always do."
